# Vein-to-blade ratio as an allometric indicator of climate-induced changes in grapevine leaf size and shape

This repository contains the dataand code used to produce the figures and tables for the manuscript *Vein-to-blade ratio as an allometric indicator of climate-induced changes in grapevine leaf size and shape*.

### Figure legends

**Figure 1: Vein-to-blade ratio is an allometric indicator of leaf size. A)** Leaves from nodes 2, 4, and 6 (left to right) counting from the growing tip of a *Vitis cinerea* shoot. On the left side of each leaf, vein (purple) and blade (green) areas calculated from homologous landmarks are shown. On the right side of the largest leaf, sinuses and lobes tips are indicated with associated ampelometric nomenclature. 1 cm scale is shown. **B)** Landmarks from the leaves in (A) but scaled to comparable areas. Note that the ratio of vein-to-blade area decreases as leaves expand. **C)** Square root of blade area, **D)** square root of vein area, and **E)** natural logarithm of the ratio of vein-to-blade area vs. year as boxplots. **F)** Scatter plot and **G)** loess regression curves (95% confidence limit) for the ln of vein-to-blade ratio vs. the ln of total leaf area. For all panels: 2013, salmon; 2015, green; 2016, turquoise; 2017, purple.

**Figure 2: Correlation of leaf shape, size, and count and total shoot and vineyard leaf areas with maximum temperature and precipitation. A)** ln of vein-to-blade ratio, **B)** leaf count per shoot, **C)** square root of total leaf area per shoot, and **D)** total leaf area for all shoots sampled (vineyard area) vs. average maximum temperature for each year as boxplots. **E-H)** The same as above but plotted against average precipitation for each year. For all panels: 2013, salmon; 2015, green; 2016, turquoise; 2017, purple.

**Figure 3: Correlations between leaf size and shape with maximum temperature and precipitation during leaf development. A)** X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) 3D reconstruction of a bud from Vitis riparia. Note cluster and leaf primordia of primary and secondary meristems that had formed the previous growing season and will grow and expand the following year. **B)** Correlation of total leaf area, vein area, blade area, and vein-to-blade ratio with daily values of leaf wetness hours (wet), precipitation (pre), maximum temperature (max), average temperature (avg), minimum temperature (min) across four years. Spearman’s rho values (purple to green, negative to positive) are shown as a 30 day sliding window for each day starting March the previous year of harvest to the harvest time of the following year at the beginning of June. Dotted box indicates a period of high correlation the summer of the previous year. **C)** Plot of maximum daily temperatures for the previous summer months. Extreme temperature events are indicated by colored arrows. **D)** Cumulative precipitation for previous summer months. Curves are colored by year. For all panels: 2012-2013, salmon; 2014-2015, green; 2015-2016, turquoise; 2016-2017, purple.
